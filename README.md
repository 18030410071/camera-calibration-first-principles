# Camera Calibration

> Python implementaion of Zhang's algorithm from first principles.

This repository implements Zhang's algorithm to calculate the intrinsic camera parameters. A checkerboard is used as the ground-truth pattern for camera calibration. To detect and order the checkerboard corners, the corner detector proposed by Y. Liu is used. The resulting algorithm is compared to OpenCV's implementation.
